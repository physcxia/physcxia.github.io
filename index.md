## Welcome to Chen Xia's Homepage

I am an assistant researcher at Shanghai Advanced Research Institute ([SARI](http://www.sari.cas.cn/)), Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CAS](https://www.cas.cn/)).
I received my Ph.D. in particle physics from the Institute of Theoretical Physics ([ITP](https://itp.cas.cn/)), CAS.
I am currently working in the field of medical physics, focusing on proton radiotherapy, isotope production, and CT image reconstruction and registration.
